# HttpClientHandler brings in about 500KB and will never be used under WebAssembly anyway
# (we have a separate browser-compatible handler).
#
# To avoid causing issues for Flurl.Http (https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/issues/1484),
# we only wipe the minimal set of methods that pull in the large dependency graph and
# don't do anything useful under WebAssembly anyway. It would be preferable if Flurl.Http
# didn't use HttpClientHandler in the case where a custom handler has been configured,
# but at the time of writing it does.

# SendAsync contains the bulk of the outbound references to HttpWebRequest etc.
System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler::SendAsync

# Dispose references ServicePointManager which is huge
System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler::Dispose
